# Hospital Management System

### Overview
This project is a comprehensive Hospital Management System designed to streamline and optimize hospital operations. The primary focus of this project is on database design and backend implementation, ensuring a robust and efficient system for managing hospital data.

### Database Design
The database design is the core of this project, utilizing MS SQL Server to create a robust and scalable database. The database schema is carefully crafted to ensure data integrity, consistency, and ease of use. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is attached as a JPEG image for clarity.

### Backend Implementation
The backend implementation is built using .NET, providing a secure and efficient interface for interacting with the database. The backend handles all database operations, including data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

### Frontend
There is a simple frontend designed for testing. However, the frontend was not the focus of this project.
